# FOCUSBUDDY
The focus app that helps you be productive as ever!
## Intro to FocusBuddy
Ever found yourself struggling to focus? Ever thought, "Man, I really want to work on this task, but I just....can't leave Youtube Shorts...What do I do? Work on this important task, or learn about the Dancing Plague of 1518?" 
Ever wish you could just shut off the distracting apps and..._work?_

Well...

Now you can!

FocusBuddy is an app that can:
+ Get a list of apps you want to block from you
+ Monitor the apps you open
+ Block an app if it's on the block list
  and much more!

## Implementation
This repo contains all the needed code for the app. Just copy it all into a new project in Android Studio! 

However, there are some things you need to do on your phone, so it runs properly. You need to have:
+ Dev Mode on
+ Accessibility allowances on
+
